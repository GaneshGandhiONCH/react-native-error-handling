      A chocolate brownie (commonly referred to as simply brownie)is a square, baked, chocolate dessert.
      Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density.
      They may include nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a blonde brownie or blondie.
      The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized in the U.S. and Canada during the first half of the 20th century.
      Brownies are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by milk, served warm with ice cream (a la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge.
      In North America they are common lunchbox treats,[citation needed] and also popular in restaurants[1] and coffeehouses.`,

    Tiramisu is a cool, refreshing Italian dessert that once tasted,
    leaves an indelible impression on you.
	  Also known as "Tuscan Trifle," the dessert was initially created in Siena, in the northwestern Italian province of Tuscany.
	  The occasion was a visit by Grand Duke Cosimo de'Medici III, in whose honor the concoction was dubbed zuppa del duca (the "duke's soup").
	  The erstwhile duke brought the dessert back with him to Florence.
	  In the 19th Century, zuppa del duca became popular among the English intellectuals and artists who lived there Consequently, it is also known as zuppa Inglese.
	  They took the dessert to England, where its popularity grew.
	  Zuppa del duca eventually made its way to Treviso, just northwest of Venice, in the northeastern province of Veneto.
	  Treviso is best know for its canals, frescoes and... Tiramisu.`,

            1¾ cup plain flour
            ¼ cup NESTLÉ Baking Cocoa
            4 tsp baking powder
            ¾ cup sugar
            100 g unsalted butter, melted
            1¼ cups trim milk
            1 egg, lightly beaten
            ¾ cup HIGHLANDER Caramel Sweetened Condensed Milk
            
            Preheat oven to 200°C. Lightly grease the muffin pans.
            Sift the flour, Baking Cocoa and baking powder into a large bowl. 
            Stir in sugar. Scoop the flour mixture towards the outside of the bowl,
            leaving a space in the centre (this is called ‘making a well’).
            Combine the melted butter, milk and beaten egg in a separate bowl.
            Pour the liquid ingredients into the well. Stir until the dry ingredients
            are just dampened. Don’t mix too much.
            Using a large spoon half fill muffin pans with mixture. Place a tablespoonful of
            Caramel Sweetened Condensed Milk on top. Put more mixture over caramel to almost fill each muffin pan.
            Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes or until muffins spring back when touched lightly in centre.
            Stand for 5 minutes, then lift out onto a rack to cool. Serve dusted with icing sugar if desired.`;
